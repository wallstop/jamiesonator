Jamiesonator
============

Beating the hell out of the Jamiesonator(tm)
--------------------------------------------

This is a relatively personal project between @wallstop and I.
We want to perfect a genetic algorithm to minimize complaints
given by the Jamiesonator - a complaint simulator for guests
of Disney's Wilderness Lodge.

This project will be implemented in C with basis upon
implementations in both Java and Python.
