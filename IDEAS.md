Choice of Language
------------------

We want to be as fast as possible, but does that mean we need to do it in straight-up ANSI C?
To be have the ability to be as fast as possible, we obviously need a compiled language that
either does not have a runtime or has a *very* thin one.

Options on the board:
 * ANSI C
 * Objective-C
 * C++

How Genetic?
